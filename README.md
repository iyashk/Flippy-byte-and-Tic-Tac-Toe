# Flippy Bite and Tic Tac Toe using Jack programming 

                                                                             - nand2tetris project

## File Hirearchy :
In this repo we have a folder named "vm" which has all the jack files :
    1. Board.jack
    2. Game.jack
    - Main.jack
    - O.jack
    - Player.jack
    - Wall.jack
    - X.jack

To run the game we will need to first use the jack compiler so as to generate the ".vm" files . Then using those files
now we can use them in the VMTranslator and then run the game and play it.

for that :
